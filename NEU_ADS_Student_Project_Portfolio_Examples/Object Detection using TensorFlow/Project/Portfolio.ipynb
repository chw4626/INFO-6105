    "## Objective \n",
    "Our objective is to identify and classify objects spotted on images and real-time video using TensorFlow and to determine the accuracy of each identification. We are considering two Models namely, SSD with MobileNet, SSD Inception V2 model and Faster RCNN Inception model to compare the accuracy and size of the models.\n",
    "The principal difference between the models is that Faster RCNN Inception V2 is optimized for accuracy, while the MobileNets are optimized to be small and efficient, at the cost of some accuracy. The SSD with MobileNets detects objects in only a single shot with just two components in its architecture namely, Feature Extraction and Detection Generator, while the Faster R-CNN consists of three components- Feature Extraction, Proposal Generation and Box Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Faster R-CNN Inception model, a region proposal network is used to generate regions of interest and then either fully-connected layers or position-sensitive convolutional layers to classify those regions. SSD does the two in a “single shot,” simultaneously predicting the bounding box and the class as it processes the image.\n"
