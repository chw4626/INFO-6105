In this lesson, we cover clustering theory, and distance & similarity measures. We use R apply and evaluate various clustering techniques such as hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering and PAM.  We look at techniques to help choose the number of clusters as well as how to evaluating cluster performance.

# Data

We'll be using GDP per capita, life expectancy, infant.mortality, and literacy data made availble by the WorldBank [data.worldbank.org](http://data.worldbank.org/)  


GDP per capita (current US$)  

GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.

Life expectancy at birth, total (years)  

Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life. Derived from male and female life expectancy at birth from sources such as: (1) United Nations Population Division. World Population Prospects, (2) United Nations Statistical Division. Population and Vital Statistics Report (various years), (3) Census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, (4) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, (5) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme, and (6) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database.  

Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)  

Infant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births in a given year. Estimates developed by the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UNICEF, WHO, World Bank, UN DESA Population Division) at [www.childmortality.org](http://www.childmortality.org/).


Literacy rate, adult total (% of people ages 15 and above)  

Adult (15+) literacy rate (%). Total is the percentage of the population age 15 and above who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, ‘literacy’ also encompasses ‘numeracy’, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of literates aged 15 years and over by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100.  


We will also be using [Francis Galton's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton) analysis of the heights of sons and fathers. Heights of sons of both tall and short fathers appeared to “revert” or “regress” to the mean of the group.  

We will also be using the [Wholesale customers Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) (Data used in Hierarchical Clustering). The data set refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories.

The data has been modified so that each row (expenses) has been simply identified as a different Region (Region 1 to 49).

# Clustering

What is [Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis)?
Clustering is grouping like with like such that:  

* Similar objects are close to one another within the same cluster.  
* Dissimilar to the objects in other clusters.

# Distance & Similarity Measures

There are two primary approaches to measure the "closeness" of data, distance and similarity. Distance measures are based in the notion of a [metric space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space).

[Similarity measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_measure) s a real-valued function that quantifies the similarity between two objects. While no single definition of a similarity measure exists, they don't necessarily have the constraint of being a metric space.  For example, [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) is a measure of the "closeness" of two vectors that is not a metric space.

## Metric Spaces

A *metric space* is an *ordered pair* $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a set and $d$ is a distance (i.e.metric) on $M$, i.e., a function:  

$d \colon M \times M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

such that for any $x, y, z \in M$, the following holds:  

* $d(x,y) \ge 0 \quad (non-negative),$  
* $d(x,y) = 0, \iff x = y \quad (identity \quad of \quad indiscernibles),$  
* $d(x,y) = d(y,x), \quad (symmetry).$  
* $d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y,z) \quad  (triangle \quad inequality)$  

### Examples of Metric Spaces

Examples of Metric Spaces are [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance), [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance), [Minkowski distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance) and many others.
 
#### Euclidean distance

Euclidean distance is the most common metric for measuring the distance between two vectors. The is the stadard Cartesian coordinates. That is, if $p = (p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and $q = (q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$\begin{align}\mathrm{d}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = \mathrm{d}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + \cdots + (q_n-p_n)^2} \\[8pt]
& = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i-p_i)^2}.\end{align}$$  


## Similarity Measures

Similarity (or dimilarity measures) measure closeness without the constraints and benefits of being a formal metric space.

### Cosine similarity

The most common form of the similarity measure is the vector inner product (or [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity))
Given vectors A and B, the vector inner product can be defined using the [Euclidean dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector#Dot_product) formula:

$$\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}
=\left\|\mathbf{a}\right\|\left\|\mathbf{b}\right\|\cos\theta$$

This similarity measure can also be ranged normalized. Alternately, we can normalize this measure by dividing each vector component by the magnitude of the vector.

### Pearson correlation

Correlation based similarity is usually the [Pearson correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient). Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient commonly represented by the Greek letter $\rho$ (rho) and is defined as:

$$ \rho_{X,Y}= \frac{\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} $$

where $\operatorname{cov}$ is the [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance) and  $\sigma_X$ is the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of $X$.  

The formula for $\rho$can be expressed in terms of mean and expectation.  

$$\operatorname{cov}(X,Y) = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]$$ 


# Clustering Data Structures

* Data matrix

$$ 
M=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & x_{1,3} & ...  & x_{1,n} \\
    x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} & x_{2,3} & ...  & x_{2,n} \\
    x_{3,1} & x_{3,2} & x_{3,3} & ...  & x_{3,n} \\    
    .. & .. & .. & ...  & .. \\    
    x_{n,1} & x_{n,2} & x_{n,3} & ...  & x_{n,n} \\    
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$

    x_{2,1} & 0  &  &   &  \\   
    x_{3,1} & x_{3,2} & 0 &   &  \\    
    .. & .. & .. & ...  & .. \\    
    x_{n,1} & x_{n,2} & x_{n,3} & ...  & 0 \\    
  \end{bmatrix}
$$

* Dissimilarity/Similarity matrix


The dissimilarity/similarity matrix is calculated by iterating over each element and calculating its dissimilarity/similarity to every other element. Let A be a Dissimilarity Matrix of size $NxN$, and $B$ a set of $N$ elements. $A_{i,j}$ is the dissimilarity/similarity between elements $B_i$ and $B_j$.  


```

   for i = 0 to N do
       for j = 0 to N do
           Aij = Dissimilarity(Bi,Bj) // or Similarity(Bi,Bj)
       end-for
   end-for
   
```     
   
where the dissimilarity/similarity matrix is usually defined as follows:

$$ 
M=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &   &  &   &  \\   
   d(2,1)  & 0  &  &   &  \\   
   d(3,1)  & d(3,2) & 0 &   &  \\    
    .. & .. & .. & ...  & .. \\    
    d(n,1)  & d(n,2) & d(n,3) & ...  & 0 \\    
  \end{bmatrix}
$$



# Types of  Clustering

[Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) (e.g., k-means, mixture models, hierarchical clustering). Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). There are various types of cluster analysis.  

* Partitioning-based clustering (K-means and its variants)
* Hierarchical clustering
* Density-based clustering

## Partitioning-based clustering (K-means and its variants)

Partitioning algorithms: Construct various partitions and then evaluate them by some criterion
Hierarchy algorithms: Create a hierarchical decomposition of the set of data (or objects) using some criterion
Density-based: based on connectivity and density functions
Grid-based: based on a multiple-level granularity structure
Model-based: A model is hypothesized for each of the clusters and the idea is to find the best fit of that model to each other


Partitioning method: Construct a partition of n documents into a set of K clusters
Given: a set of documents and the number K 
Find: a partition of K clusters that optimizes the chosen partitioning criterion
Globally optimal
Intractable for many objective functions
Ergo, exhaustively enumerate all partitions
Effective heuristic methods: K-means and K-medoids algorithms


### K-means

The term "k-means" was first used by James MacQueen in 1967,[1] though the idea goes back to Hugo Steinhaus in 1957. Given a desired $k$ clusters and n data points $X = {x_1, x_2, …, x_n}$: 

Initialize centroids $\mu_1, \mu_1, ... \mu_k \quad \in \quad  \mathbb{R}^n$  (usually randomly)  


while (not coverged):

Step A (Assignment step):  

  Find the closest cluster to every point in $X = {x_1, x_2, …, x_n}$
  
  That is,   
$$\underset{\mathbf{X}} {\operatorname{arg\,min}}  \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{\mathbf x \in X_i} \left\| \mathbf x - \boldsymbol\mu_i \right\|^2$$

where $\mu_i$ is the mean of points in $X_i$.

$$
S_i^{(t)} = \big \{ x_p : \big \| x_p - m^{(t)}_i \big \|^2 \le \big \| x_p - m^{(t)}_j \big \|^2 \ \forall j, 1 \le j \le k \big\}
$$  

Step B (Update step): 

  Calculate the new means to be the centroids of the observations in the new clusters.

$$
m^{(t+1)}_i = \frac{1}{|X^{(t)}_i|} \sum_{x_j \in X^{(t)}_i} x_j 
$$

The [centroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid) of a finite set of {k} points  

$$
\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_k in \mathbb{R}^n \quad is\quad 
\mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_1+\mathbf{x}_2+\cdots+\mathbf{x}_k}{k}
$$


#### Demonstration of the k-means algorithm

Demonstration of the standard algorithm (from [k-means algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Standard_algorithm)  

![k initial controids](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/K_Means_Example_Step_1.svg/249px-K_Means_Example_Step_1.svg.png)  

1. k initial "means" (in this case k=3) are randomly generated within the data domain (shown in color).  

![find nearest cluster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/K_Means_Example_Step_2.svg/278px-K_Means_Example_Step_2.svg.png)  

2. k clusters are created by associating every observation with the nearest mean. The partitions here represent the [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) generated by the means.  

![new centroid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/K_Means_Example_Step_3.svg/278px-K_Means_Example_Step_3.svg.png)  

3. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new mean.  

![k-means algorithm converges](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/K_Means_Example_Step_4.svg/278px-K_Means_Example_Step_4.svg.png)  

4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence has been reached. The k-means algorithm converges when no points are assigned new clusters.  

#### Problems with k-means clustering

For problems with k-means clustering see [K-means clustering is not a free lunch](http://varianceexplained.org/r/kmeans-free-lunch/)


### K-medoids (PAM)

The K-medoids or Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm (Kaufman & Rousseeuw’87) is related to the k-means algorithm and but uses medoid shifts rather than reassigning points based on Euclidean distance.  Each cluster is represented by one of the objects (i.e. points) in the cluster  A medoid is a point in a cluster whose dissimilarity to all the points in the cluster is minimal. Medoids are similar in concept to means or centroids, but medoids are always members of the data set. That is, in 2D [Cartesian space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) a centroid can be any valid x.y coordinate. Whereas a medoid must be one of the data points. (The data point least dissimilar to the rest.)

Pseduocode for the k-medoid clustering (Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)) algorithm:  


```
Initialize: randomly select[citation needed] (without replacement) k of the n data points as the medoids

Associate each data point to the closest medoid.

While the cost of the configuration decreases:
  For each medoid m, for each non-medoid data point o:
    Swap m and o, recompute the cost

  If the total cost of the configuration increased in the previous step, undo   the swap.

```


## Hierarchical clustering

In [hierarchical clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering) the idea is to group data objects (i.e. points) into a tree of clusters. That is, hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. 

These trees (hierarchies) generally fall into two types:

### Agglomerative hierarchical clustering 

Initially each data object (i.e. point) in its own cluster. Iteratively the clusters are merged together from the "bottom-up." The two most similar/closest objects are aggreated in to the same cluster/data object. Then the next two, until there is just one cluster/data object. This agglomerative approach result in “straggly” (long and thin) clusters due to a chaining effect. It is also sensitive to noise.



### Divisive hierarchical clustering 

in divisive hierarchical clustering all data objects (i.e. points) are initially in one cluster. These clusters are successively divided recursivley in a "top-down" manner. The cluster is broken in to two clusters that are most dissimilar. Then each of those clusters is broken in to two cluster that are most dissimilar. This continues until each clsuter is a single data object (i.e. point).

### Linkage criteria

* Single Link: smallest distance between points
    + $\min \, \{\, d(a,b) : a \in A,\, b \in B \,\}$
* Complete Link: largest distance between points
    +  $\max \, \{\, d(a,b) : a \in A,\, b \in B \,\}$
* Average Link: average distance between points
    + $\frac{1}{|A| |B|} \sum_{a \in A }\sum_{ b \in B} d(a,b)$ 
* Centroid: distance between centroids
    +  $||c_s - c_t ||$  where $c_s$ and $c_t$ are the centroids of clusters $s$ and $t$, respectively.
* Minimum energy clustering: a statistical distance between probability distributions.
    +  $\frac{2}{nm}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n,m} \|a_i- b_j\|_2 - \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \|a_i-a_j\|_2 - \frac{1}{m^2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{m} \|b_i-b_j\|_2 $


## Density-based clustering

Density-based clustering is similar to k-means clustering, except that it uses the [expectation-maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm), to generate a likelihood that for each data objects (i.e. points) belong to a cluster. In the special case of a Gaussian mixture model, specifically, the limit of taking all covariances as diagonal, equal, and small. A k-means problem can be  generalized into a Gaussian mixture model.

Density-based clustering uses a density estimator to learn a probalistic mapping from a set of attributes to a probability.

Input -> Density Estimator -> Probability

Given a data object x(i.e. point), a density estimator M can tell you how likely x belongs to cluster k.

Given a statistical model which generates a set $\mathbf{X}$ of observed data (e.g. assuming it comes for a Gaussian distribution), a set of unobserved latent data or missing values $\mathbf{Z}$, and a vector of unknown parameters $\boldsymbol\theta$, along with a likelihood function $L(\boldsymbol\theta; \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Z}) = p(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Z}|\boldsymbol\theta),$ the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the unknown parameters is determined by the marginal likelihood of the observed data $L(\boldsymbol\theta; \mathbf{X}) = p(\mathbf{X}|\boldsymbol\theta) = \sum_{\mathbf{Z}} p(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z}|\boldsymbol\theta)$  


The EM algorithm seeks to find the MLE of the marginal likelihood by iteratively applying the following two steps:

Expectation step (E step): Calculate the expected value of the log likelihood function, with respect to the conditional distribution of $\mathbf{Z}$ given $\mathbf{X}$ under the current estimate of the parameters  

$$\boldsymbol\theta^{(t)}:
Q(\boldsymbol\theta|\boldsymbol\theta^{(t)}) = \operatorname{E}_{\mathbf{Z}|\mathbf{X},\boldsymbol\theta^{(t)}}\left[ \log L(\boldsymbol\theta;\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Z})  \right] $$  

Maximization step (M step): Find the parameter that maximizes this quantity:

$$ \boldsymbol\theta^{(t+1)} = \underset{\boldsymbol\theta}{\operatorname{arg\,max}} Q(\boldsymbol\theta|\boldsymbol\theta^{(t)})
$$


# Good Clustering?

Evaluation of clustering results sometimes is referred to as cluster validation.

* high intra-class distance/similarity
* low inter-class distance/similarity 


Cluster Cohesion: Measures how closely related are objects in a cluster.  

Cluster Separation: Measure how distinct or well-separated a cluster is from other clusters.  


The quality of a clustering result depends on both the similarity measure used by the method and its implementation

## Visualization

There are a number of packages for plotting clusters:

* R package [rggobi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rggobi/index.html) along with [GGobi.org](http://www.ggobi.org/)
* R package [clusterfly](http://had.co.nz/model-vis/)
* other R packages 

We'll focus on dendrograms,  multidimensional scaling (MDS) and plotting a confusion matrix.

### Dendrogram

A [dendrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram) is a tree data structure which illustrates hierarchical (or taxonomic) relationships

* Each level shows clusters for that level.
* Leaf – individual clusters
* Root – one cluster
* A cluster at level $i$ is the union of its children clusters at level $i+1$


![A dendrogram](http://54.198.163.24/YouTube/MachineLearning/M04/Dendrogram.png)

*A dendrogram*

### Multidimensional scaling (MDS) 

[Multidimensional scaling (MDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual cases of a high-dimenional dataset.

Given a dataset of I objects (colors, faces, stocks, . . .) on which a distance function is defined, $\delta_{i,j} :=$ distance between $i-th$ and $j-th$ objects. These distances are the entries of the dissimilarity matrix
$$
\Delta := 
\begin{pmatrix}
\delta_{1,1} & \delta_{1,2} & \cdots & \delta_{1,I} \\
\delta_{2,1} & \delta_{2,2} & \cdots & \delta_{2,I} \\
\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\delta_{I,1} & \delta_{I,2} & \cdots & \delta_{I,I}
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

The goal of MDS is, given $\Delta$, to find I vectors $x_1,\ldots,x_I \in \mathbb{R}^N$ such that $\|x_i - x_j\| \approx \delta_{i,j}$ for all $i,j\in {1,\dots,I}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ is a vector norm. In classical MDS, this norm is the Euclidean distance, but,  it may be a metric or arbitrary distance function.  

In other words, MDS attempts to find an embedding from the I objects into $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that distances are preserved.

*An example of classical multidimensional scaling applied to voting patterns in the United States House of Representatives*

### Confusion plots

confusion plot is a plot of the [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). A confusion matrix, also known as a contingency table or an error matrix. 


A confusion matrix is a 2x2 table with counts of the following in each of its quadrents.

```
true positive (TP)
eqv. with hit
true negative (TN)
eqv. with correct rejection
false positive (FP)
eqv. with false alarm, Type I error
false negative (FN)
eqv. with miss, Type II error
```

## Cluster evaluation metics

Cluster evaluation metics quantitate within cluster cohesion and between cluster Separation.

### Measuring Cluster Validity via Correlation

Compute can compute the correlation between the two matrices (a proximity patrix and “incidence” matrix). Since the matrices are symmetric, only the correlation between $frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ entries needs to be calculated. (ie. above or below the diagonal).

High correlation indicates that points that belong to the same cluster are close to each other. This is not a good measure for some density or contiguity based clusters.

*Proximity Matrix*

A proximity is a measurement of the similarity or dissimilarity, broadly defined, of a pair of objects. If measured for all pairs of objects in a set (e.g. driving distances among a set of U.S. cities), the proximities are represented by an object-by-object proximity matrix.

“Incidence” Matrix

An “incidence” matrix

* One row and one column for each data point
* An entry is 1 if the associated pair of points belong to the same cluster
* An entry is 0 if the associated pair of points belongs to different clusters

### Using Similarity Matrix for Cluster Validation

One can sort the similarity matrix with respect to cluster labels amd then plot.

### Davies–Bouldin index  

The [Davies–Bouldin index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index) can be represented by the formula below:

$$ DB = \frac {1} {n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \max_{j\neq i}\left(\frac{\sigma_i + \sigma_j} {d(c_i,c_j)}\right)
$$

where n is the number of clusters,$c_x$ is the centroid of cluster x, $\sigma_x$ is the average distance of all elements in cluster x to centroid $c_x$, and $d(c_i,c_j)$ is the distance between centroids $c_i$ and $c_j$.

Clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index.

### Dunn index

The [Dunn index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunn_index) aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:

$$
D = \frac{\min_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} d(i,j)}{\max_{1 \leq k \leq n} d^{\prime}(k)} \,
$$

where $d(i,j)$ represents the distance between clusters $i$ and $j$, and $d '(k)$ measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster $k$. The inter-cluster distance $d(i,j)$ between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the centroids of the clusters. 

Clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, produce clusters with high Dunn index (i.e. are more desirable).


### Silhouette coefficient

The silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with k-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters.


### Purity  (as an evaluation measure)

Simple measure: purity, the ratio between the dominant class in the cluster $c_i$ and the size of cluster$c_i$. To compute purity , each cluster is assigned to the class which is most frequent in the cluster, and then the accuracy of this assignment is measured by counting the number of correctly assigned documents and dividing by $N$. Formally: 

$$
\mbox{purity}(\mathbb{C_i}) = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_k \max_j (n_{i,j}) \quad j \in \mathbb{C}
$$

Note that this is biased because having n clusters for n data objects maximizes purity.

### Entropy (as an evaluation measure)

The notion of entropy can be used to evauluate the "stickness"  or mutual information between classes and clusters They can measure how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other.  In a sense we want to measure how "sticky" within cluster data is and how  "non-sticky" the between cluster data is. There are several ways to use entropy to measure "stickness."

#### Mutual Information

[Mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) quantifies the mutual dependence of the two random variables. It is a measure of the “stickiness” between two items. It measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other. We can use mutual information to quantify the association between two tags. Mutual information is given by:
$$
 I(X;Y) = \sum_{y \in Y} \sum_{x \in X} 
                 p(x,y) \log{ \left(\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)\,p(y)}
                              \right) }, \,\!
                              
$$

where $p(x,y)$ is the joint probability distribution function of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal probability distribution functions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.

#### Kullback-Leibler divergence

[Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) is a non-symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. The Kullback-Leibler measure goes by several names: relative entropy, discrimination information, Kullback-Leibler (KL) number, directed divergence, informational divergence, and cross entropy. Kullback-Leibler divergence is a measure of the difference between the observed entropy and its excepted entropy. We calculate the KL divergence by weighting one distribution (like an observed frequency distribution) by the log of probabilities of some other distribution. For discrete probability distributions P and Q, the Kullback–Leibler divergence of Q from P is defined to be:

$$
D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\|Q) = \sum_i P(i) \, \ln\frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}
$$

In words, it is the expectation of the logarithmic difference between the probabilities P and Q, where the expectation is taken using the probabilities P.

#### Jaccard similarity coefficient 

The [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), also known as the Jaccard similarity coefficient (originally coined coefficient de communauté by Paul Jaccard), is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. If $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) and \mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$) are two vectors with all real $x_i, y_i \geq 0$, then their Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined as

$$
J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = \frac{\sum_i \min(x_i, y_i)}{\sum_i \max(x_i, y_i)},
$$

and Jaccard distance

$$
d_J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = 1 - J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}).
$$



### Rand index

The [Rand index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index) or Rand measure (named after William M. Rand) in statistics, and in particular in data clustering, is a measure of the similarity between two data clusterings. A form of the Rand index may be defined that is adjusted for the chance grouping of elements, this is the adjusted Rand index. 

Given a set of $n$ elements $S = \{o_1, \ldots, o_n\}$ and two partitions of $S$ to compare, $X = \{X_1, \ldots, X_r\}$, a partition of $S$ into $r$ subsets, and $Y = \{Y_1, \ldots, Y_s\}$, a partition of $S$ into $s$ subsets, define the following:  

* $a$, the number of pairs of elements in $S$ that are in the same set in $X$  and in the same set in $Y$ (i.e. true positive (TP))
* $b$, the number of pairs of elements in $S$  that are in different sets $X$  and in different sets in $Y$ (i.e false positive (FP))
* $c$, the number of pairs of elements in $S$  that are in the same set in $X$ and in different sets in $Y$ (false negative (FN))
* $d$, the number of pairs of elements in $S$  that are in different sets in $X$ and in the same set in $Y$ (i.e. true negative (TN))

The Rand index, R, is:

$$
 RI = \frac{a+b}{a+b+c+d} = \frac{a+b}{{n \choose 2 }}
$$ 
 
Intuitively, $a + b$ can be considered as the number of agreements between $X$ and $Y$ and $c + d$ as the number of disagreements between $X$ and $Y$.


![Rand Index](http://54.198.163.24/YouTube/MachineLearning/M04/Rand_Index.png)

The Rand index can be used to create a cluster F-measure.

$$
 RI = \frac{a+b}{a+b+c+d}
$$ 
 
 
Compare with standard Precision and Recall:


$$
 Precision = \frac{a}{a+c}
$$ 

$$
 Recall = \frac{a}{a+d}
$$ 

 
Compare with a confusion matrix:

A confusion matrix is a 2x2 table with counts of the following in each of its quadrents.

```
true positive (TP) 
eqv. with hit
true negative (TN)
eqv. with correct rejection
false positive (FP)
eqv. with false alarm, Type I error
false negative (FN)
eqv. with miss, Type II error
``` 

# K-means clustering in R

K-means clustering in R.  Can we cluster gender by height using the Galton regression data?
 

```{r}
qplot(x=Height, data=h.gend, geom="density", group=Gender, color=Gender)
k<-2
galton.2.clust<-kmeans(h.gend[,c("Height")],k)
galton.2.clust

```


Create confusion matrix and plot it.  Note we can only do this becuase we know what the gender actually is. Note that runningh it twice can get different results.


```{r}
cm<-table(h.gend$Gender,galton.2.clust$cluster) # Confustion Matrix
cm
plot(cm)
galton.2.clust<-kmeans(h.gend[,c("Height")],k)
galton.2.clust
cm2<-table(h.gend$Gender,galton.2.clust$cluster) # Confustion Matrix
cm2
plot(cm2)
```

Clustering the World Bank data.  

```{r}
head(wb)
k<-2
wb.2.clust<- kmeans(wb,k) 
wb.2.clust
k<-3
wb.3.clust<- kmeans(wb,k) 
wb.3.clust
```

for (i in 2:10) sos[i] <- sum(kmeans(wb, centers=i)$withinss)
plot(1:10, sos, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters", ylab="sum of squares")
plot(2:10, sos[c(2:10)], type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters", ylab="sum of squares")
# Hartigans's rule  FitKMean (similarity)

best<-FitKMeans(wb,max.clusters=10, seed=111) 
PlotHartigan(best)
```

le<-aggregate(data = wb, Life.expectancy ~ wb.6.clust$cluster, mean)
le

print(wb.6.clust)
```

### Plotting Clusters

```{r}
plot(wb,col=wb.6.clust$cluster)     # Plot Clusters
plot(wb[c("Per.capita.income","Literacy")],col=wb.6.clust$cluster)      
points(wb.6.clust$centers, col = 1:2, pch = 8) 
# Centroid Plot against 1st two discriminant functions
clusplot(wb, wb.6.clust$cluster, color=TRUE, shade=TRUE, labels=2, lines=0)
# library(fpc)
# plotcluster(wb,wb.6.clust$cluster)
```


# K-medoids clustering in R

wb.pam.4.clust<- pam(wb,k, keep.diss = TRUE, keep.data = TRUE)
wb.pam.4.clust
plot(wb.pam.4.clust, which.plots = 2)
# long lines good - means greater within cluster similarity
```

## Gap statistic

Gap statistic

clusGap() calculates a goodness of clustering measure, the “gap” statistic. For each number of clusters k, it compares $\log(W(k))$ with $E^*[\log(W(k))]$ where the latter is defined via bootstrapping, i.e. simulating from a reference distribution.  

maxSE(f, SE.f) determines the location of the maximum of f, taking a “1-SE rule” into account for the *SE* methods. The default method "firstSEmax" looks for the smallest k such that its value f(k) is not more than 1 standard error away from the first local maximum. This is similar but not the same as "Tibs2001SEmax", Tibshirani et al's recommendation of determining the number of clusters from the gap statistics and their standard deviations.  

See [clusGap](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/cluster/html/clusGap.html)   

```{r}
gap<-clusGap(wb,FUNcluster=pam,K.max=10) # Bootstrapping
gap$Tab
gdf<-as.data.frame(gap$Tab)
head(gdf)
qplot(x=1:nrow(gdf),y=logW,data = gdf,geom="line",color="red")+geom_point(aes(y=logW),color="orange")+geom_line(aes(y=E.logW),color="blue")+geom_point(aes(y=E.logW),color="purple")
# Gap statistic
qplot(x=1:nrow(gdf),y=gap,data = gdf,geom="line",color="red")+geom_point(aes(y=gap),color="orange")+geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=gap-SE.sim,ymax=gap+SE.sim),color="brown")
```
